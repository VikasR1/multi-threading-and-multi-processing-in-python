# Multi-processing in Python
''' 
if we want to take advantage of multi-core systems and eventually
run tasks in a truly parallelised context, we need to perform multi-processing instead 
of multi-threading.

In Python, multi-processing can be implemented using the "multiprocessing" module 
(or concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor) that can be used in order to spawn multiple OS processes.

multiprocessing is a package that supports spawning processes using an API
similar to the threading module.
